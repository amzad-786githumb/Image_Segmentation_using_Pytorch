**[Image Segmentation](https://www.ibm.com/topics/image-segmentation#:~:text=Image%20segmentation%20is%20a%20computer,faster%2C%20more%20advanced%20image%20processing.):** Image segmentation is a computer vision technique that partitions a digital image into discrete groups of pixels‚Äîimage segments‚Äîto inform object detection and related tasks. By parsing an image‚Äôs complex visual data into specifically shaped segments, image segmentation enables faster, more advanced image processing.


**[U-Nets](https://www.ibm.com/topics/image-segmentation#:~:text=Image%20segmentation%20is%20a%20computer,faster%2C%20more%20advanced%20image%20processing.):** U-Nets modify FCN architecture to reduce data loss during downsampling with skip connections, preserving greater detail by selectively bypassing some convolutional layers as information and gradients move through the neural network. Its name is derived from the shape of diagrams demonstrating the arrangement of its layers.
